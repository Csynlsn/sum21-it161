            <p>Born with a genuine intuitive gift &amp; fueled with a lifelong passion for metaphysics, Raven has spent more than 30 years doing research, study and practice in the areas of tarot, astrology, herbs and aromatherapy.
              Born here in the Pacific Northwest, Raven made her way to Seattle in 1998. After spending a few years working in the “corporate world”, Raven became disheartened and increasingly unhappy and decided to make her passion a full-time career and has never looked back. Professionally practicing since 2002, she is now an accomplished and well-known tarot &amp; astrology reader, teacher, and entertainer. 
              Raven bases her practice in Seattle, WA &amp; has provided thousands of clients all over the world a variety of different types of readings, providing them insight, guidance, healing &amp; joy.

            <p>Born in 1974 in Wuppertal, Germany, self-taught artist Yvette Endrijautzki immigrated to the United States in 2006.
               In 2009, she established her own studio &amp; gallery, The Nautilus Studio, in the culturally bourgeoning Georgetown neighborhood of Seattle. Throughout the last 8 years, sculptural space has been Yvette’s focus. Her use of recycled materials, found objects, &amp; broken artifacts has challenged her to create something unprecedented &amp; unique. 
               Always on the hunt for new techniques, objects &amp; materials, she regards the creative process not as choice, but rather the raison d’ être for the artist, where she can lose &amp; find herself.
                A book of her recent body of work was published in 2015.
