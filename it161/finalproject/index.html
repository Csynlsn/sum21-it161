          <p class="center">The deck is an electronic assemblage of the artwork of Yvette Endrijautzki, &amp; based on the writings of astrologer, teacher, &amp; tarot reader, Raven Bella Zingaro. 
            Each card is a collage of information from several different realms &amp; modalities. The deck is designed to be read easily, even by individuals with no tarot background.
             In addition to traditional tarot symbolism, our deck includes planetary and astrological references, crystals, chakras, Shamanic symbols, &amp; depictions of flora and fauna. 
            The Major Arcana &amp; Court Cards are printed in Latin, which is our nod to the classic history of the Tarot. The Minor Arcana are in English. 
            Each deck has 78 cards, 86x127mm (3.38" x 5") &amp; is printed on 300gsm white core paper with a matte varnish finish. The deck comes in a 2-piece styled box.</p>

        <h2 class="subheader">Our Story</h2>
        <p>Raven &amp; Yvette, friends &amp; co-workers at Tenzing MoMo in Seattle's famed Pike Place Market, felt a strong connection to the project from its inception. The project spanned many years &amp; the two continued their
          collaborative efforts even while living on separate continents. The deck was officially finished on 02.22.2020 at 11:59pm in Brussels, Belgium, just before the world shut down due to the pandemic.</p>
         <p>Currently in its 2nd printing, the Farrago Spiritum Tarot is available for purchase on Etsy.</p>
